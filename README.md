Pixel Wave Survival Game

This a public repo for all code used in a new game project. Includes only code written by me. Scripts from external packages used in the project are not included.

Packages required for all scripts to work:
- A* pathfinding project pro

Pixel Wave Survival (placeholder name) is a 2D, top-down, wave-based survival shooter. 
Expect more info once I get the project up and running.
