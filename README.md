Pixel Wave Survival Game

This a public repo for all code used in a new game project being built with Unity.

Includes only code written by me. 
Scripts from external packages used in the project are not included.

Critical packages required for some scripts:
- A* pathfinding project pro 
- Input System

Pixel Wave Survival (placeholder name) is a 2D, top-down, wave-based survival shooter. 
Expect more info once I get the project up and running.
